# tinyMAX7219
A small library for the ATtiny85 to communicate with a MAX7219-LED-driver over USI  

max7219_driver is the implementation of the USI-communication  
max7219_matrix is an interface for a 8x8 pixel-matrix based on the MAX7219-LED-driver  


The code was tested on the ATtiny85 but should work as well on the ATtiny25 and the ATtiny45.
